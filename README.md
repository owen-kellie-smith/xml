# xml
This repo provides an xml file (based on data from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries website) plus two xsl files and a css file.

One xsl file is used to format the xml as a single human-readable webpage (which is then coloured bi the css file).

The other xsl file reformats the xml in the format required to import MediaWiki pages.

To switch between the two views (or to see the plain xml), edit or delete the line near the top of Presentations.xml which starts 

  <?xml-stylesheet  ...  />
